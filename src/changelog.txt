This is my changelog. 
My site is kind of a blog but it really isn't telling the changes of it.

I got rid of a bunch of SRE related posts because I think SRE is kind of a lost 
cause here where I live. I like the discipline and the exercise of improving 
performance and availability,  but on a honest take,  I think this has mutated
into an overpaid Kubernetes operators role and it got fucking boring,  I'm out.
I am adding this changelog to the page and updated the upload script with the
purpose of making it more efficient; I also took the chance to lint a bunch of
Python code, because, well: I like to understand my own code.

I think a dark style theme is a must nowadays, so if your browser allows it,
the page will follow.

03-12-2025
Not relevant for this blog, but for its publishing times, I made a bunch of
tasks asynchronous since they really don't need to be blocking (validations
mostly). Nothing to brag about though, these were low hanging fruits.

05-12-2025
Not really associated to this site, but to my activities. I am taking some time
away from this and other sites that aren't helping me build skills or connect-
ing with people I care. I simply added a pi-hole entry with this and many other
sites I visit frequently, with the idea of only turning off this list for an
hour or two during the weekends. Wish me luck!

I still find my landing page quite unsettling, it serves no purpose to be fair.
I think it should go away from the navigation at least, so it is gone already!
I also find no need to keep a JS file for the site when most of the actions can
be contained in a simple <script> tag. So I changed that too.

15-01-2026
I am adding a random thoughts page. I need a notebook!
