## Ramon Garcia's blog

Thanks for stopping by, I know this format is not very conventional, but hey, free hosting and you get to see my mess of a writing process!

Anyway, this is my blog, I am a highly opinionated technology enthusiast trying to explore different ideas and trends. This site started as a Github pages, but I lost all interest in using Github. Then I moved it to [Neocities](https://neocities.org) ❤️, but there's a weird stigma around those pages and traffic gets blocked from time to time. So back to square, I maintain this in ✨**[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ramongarciamx/rgarciamx)**✨, but push it to [Github](https://github.com/monchitos82/rgarciamx) too, to allow unauthenticated views. Sounds complicated, but `git push` takes care of everything.

Feel like getting in touch? Drop me a message.
