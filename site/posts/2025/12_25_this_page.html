    <h3>How this page was built (12/25)</h3>
    <p>I started this page as a blog and I have changed it so frequently that it is hard to describe what it is, and its
        purpose. I added a <a href="../../changelog.txt" target="blank_">changelog</a> to describe what changed within,
        but I wanted to take the chance to write about this site itself.</p>
    <p>The reason for this, is mostly to document a simple build pipeline with no special tools or artifacts; I mean, I
        integrated some <em>CI/CD</em> for the sake of automation, but in reality, this whole thing really just needs a
        script and <em>Neocities</em> to go live on every change.</p>
    <p>I didn&rsquo;t pick any shinny tool or platform because I really enjoy the crafting process. Sometimes I write
        these things in plain <em>HTML</em>, although it is not the most efficient way (that&rsquo;s why
        <em>Markdown</em> is the default format).</p>
    <p>I can say the same about other parts of this page. It used to leverage on <em>Bootstrap</em> and some
        <em>JavaScript</em>, even some stats using <em>G4A</em> when I had it hosted at <em>Github</em> pages, but all
        those are gone, because, I just don&rsquo;t care about adding dead weight to this page. It still uses some
        <em>CSS</em> and templates, frankly, this site is as vanilla as it gets with modern browsers.</p>
    <p>Behind the scenes it is not much different what happens for this page. I might take ideas from here and there,
        especially for the robots and style files, but that&rsquo;s just me being lazy about trying weird things and
        breaking the site. Normally, every entry starts with a new <em>Markdown</em> file getting created. From there
        all I need to to do is the real hard part, write the post.</p>
    <p>Once the post is ready, the publishing process just follows a few simple steps on my end: It is all about storing
        this in a repository and let it go.</p>
    <p>When I say &ldquo;let it go&rdquo;, I mean, the update happens, then the changes go through a very simple build
        process in a <em>Jenkins</em> container:</p>
    <pre>
Repository update
  |
  ∟ Build HTMLs
       |
       ∟ Rebuild Indices
            |
            ∟ Async Validations (broken anchors and foul language)
              RSS build
                    |
                    ∟ Publish site using its API
                        |
                        ∟ Cleanup
</pre>

    <p>That&rsquo;s it. Simple as it is, I enjoy doing this and connecting pieces and ideas. I used to build other
        sections like a <em>snippets</em> one, but I decided not to dedicate a menu for it, or any other than the actual
        posts. I am experimenting using <em>Ollama</em> calls to add descriptions to the indices, but I think the result
        is not compelling enough to actually devote time for the models to produce an abstract, it just feels like an
        overhead. I think this site has evolved both in what I want to show and how I want it to work. Simplicity has
        been key for me to keep this project alive, and I think this will continue being my companion.</p>
