    <h3>A small parenthesis on capacity (09/24)</h3>
    <p>I will start this one by posting a term I forgot to mention in a recent conversation: <strong>load
            testing</strong></p>
    <p>Capacity planning is a very interesting discussion; it requires knowing where you&rsquo;re standing and where
        you&rsquo;re going. I just had a conversation where we discussed vertical vs. horizontal scaling. But the
        conversation can only start when you know where you are standing and for that understanding to happen, you need
        to know what are your current limits (limits are good, this is one of the most important lessons I have ever
        learned in my career), that&rsquo;s where load testing comes into play. </p>
    <p>Yes, you will add buffering in different layers to disperse the load and you will break the problem you try to
        solve to improve your ability to scale, but that is step number two.</p>
