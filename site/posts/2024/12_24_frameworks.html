    <h3>On frameworks and languages (12/24)</h3>
    <p>Yes, this is one more of those posts. I was just exploring the <em>what-abouts</em> of <em>FastAPI</em>. I was
        interested in how hard or how easy it is to get it to work compared to <em>Flask</em> or <em>Django</em>.</p>
    <p>I find that it is super easy to get it working and I really liked it, but to be fair, it still brings a bunch of
        dependencies that a language like <em>go</em> just natively has (<em>Go&rsquo;s</em> tooling is slick). And that
        brought me to the questioning on why are <em>frameworks</em> proliferating at all? Not long ago I spent some
        time reading about the need to push back on things like React and come to believe that if <em>JavaScript</em>
        had offered a bunch of much needed functionality like async calls, a lot of these <em>framework</em> nightmares
        would simply not exist. Yes, <em>JavaScript</em> is a terrible example, but thinking about <em>Java</em>, well,
        it is not very different, and possibly the list just goes on because, well, if the language is complete, and
        getting things done does not require an obscene amount of code, do you really need the <em>framework</em>?</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t have many friends I can bring on the conversation and ended up asking <em>ChatGPT</em> about this
        and well, it started using a lot the term <em>&ldquo;over-engineering&rdquo;</em> which brought the conversation
        from <em>frameworks</em> and language features completeness to more weird concepts like cloud native
        applications and to even harder topics like accountability and why engineering is a very condescending word in a
        world of do as you go.</p>
    <p>Anyway <em>FastAPI</em> is nice, but old me thinks <em>go</em> (particularly its tooling) is nicer, even when it
        has some weird traits.</p>
