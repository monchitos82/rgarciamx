### A small parenthesis on capacity (09/24)

I will start this one by posting a term I forgot to mention in a recent conversation: **load testing**

Capacity planning is a very interesting discussion; it requires knowing where you're standing and where you're going. I just had a conversation where we discussed vertical vs. horizontal scaling. But the conversation can only start when you know where you are standing and for that understanding to happen, you need to know what are your current limits (limits are good, this is one of the most important lessons I have ever learned in my career), that's where load testing comes into play. 

Yes, you will add buffering in different layers to disperse the load and you will break the problem you try to solve to improve your ability to scale, but that is step number two.
