### On frameworks and languages (12/24)

Yes, this is one more of those posts. I was just exploring the _what-abouts_ of _FastAPI_. I was interested in how hard or how easy it is to get it to work compared to _Flask_ or _Django_.

I find that it is super easy to get it working and I really liked it, but to be fair, it still brings a bunch of dependencies that a language like _go_ just natively has (_Go's_ tooling is slick). And that brought me to the questioning on why are _frameworks_ proliferating at all? Not long ago I spent some time reading about the need to push back on things like React and come to believe that if _JavaScript_ had offered a bunch of much needed functionality like async calls, a lot of these _framework_ nightmares would simply not exist. Yes, _JavaScript_ is a terrible example, but thinking about _Java_, well, it is not very different, and possibly the list just goes on because, well, if the language is complete, and getting things done does not require an obscene amount of code, do you really need the _framework_?

I don't have many friends I can bring on the conversation and ended up asking _ChatGPT_ about this and well, it started using a lot the term _"over-engineering"_ which brought the conversation from _frameworks_ and language features completeness to more weird concepts like cloud native applications and to even harder topics like accountability and why engineering is a very condescending word in a world of do as you go.

Anyway _FastAPI_ is nice, but old me thinks _go_ (particularly its tooling) is nicer, even when it has some weird traits.
