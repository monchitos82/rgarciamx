### The year of Linux will never come (01/26)

Every year, since the past decade I keep reading the same post: "This is the year of _Linux_". Every time it is because either something great happened to _Linux_ or more often, because Windows keeps degrading its quality.

But in a grounded take, I think it is about time to accept there is never going to be the year of _Linux_ -for the desktop, especially- and it is actually a good thing.

_Linux_ has forever been a battleground for projects. Not only desktop environments. And even though most of those environments are far more mature than when I started using _Linux_ back in college, they are still full of good intentions and bad decisions, and I believe, none of those are bad things. I think however, we are ignoring a fact in the consumer mindset, most people don't really want to spend time using their computers and if they do, they want to use what others seem to enjoy... _Linux_ is not in that list, but Apple has just perfectly filled that spot for decades.

Now, I think those who claim the year of _Linux_ is going to be... soon, are being oblivious to the fact that "the year of _Linux_" already happened about a decade ago and keeps repeating itself year after year. You have Android everywhere, you have Steam everything, you have whatever Amazon had put together and it is not stopping there, most of the cloud is _Linux_ at this point, yes, the latter is not making sense to the _Linux_ on the desktop, but to be fair, _Linux_ on the desktop is working since ages, it is just the horrible, horrible mix of unnecessary features that manufacturers cram together that makes it unstable, let alone the commercial reasons behind (and being fair, _Linux_ applications and fonts are simply subpar in design). In any case a countless amount of people and organizations have actually made the effort to put their products, especially developer focused ones, in _Linux_, and I come to believe that is good enough.

As someone using _Linux_ on an ASUS laptop **every day** 🤮, I know how horrible is the _Linux_ experience when you don't settle for the basics, where the OS is solid, but you need to accept the compromises and adapt to it, except most consumers would find that unacceptable, so I cannot blame them for not wanting to deal with this mess, but let me be clear: This is not a problem with _Linux_, manufacturers: they just don't care.

Anyway, I think the year of _Linux_ will just never come, but that has not stopped the kernel from being everywhere, in every device, in every circumstance. I think that desktop environments are never going to settle for one or the other and I think that lack of stability is terribly good for inventive, but the lack of acceptance from the end user is a price, that in my opinion, is worth paying. You will still have us the nerds using your projects, your experiments and learning to live with them. The rest, they are right to use Apple and those settling for whatever garbage Microsoft put together with their copilot era, will eventually make the jump when budget allows it, but they will unlikely move to the free option, even if it's free, because _Linux_ price often comes in a resource far more valuable than money: Time.

Having said that, I still love _Linux_, and I will stay in _Linux_ for as long as I can, it just works... for me.
