### Lessons I learned from people smarter than me (12/25)


This is an easy post to write and one that I am afraid will keep on growing. I am not the smartest person, which is somehow a good thing, because there's always someone smarter that I can look up to and learn from. So without saying more, here's a list of lessons that I have learned (or learnt) over the years from the people who have somehow come across my life. The list will not make sense, these are just lessons that somehow impacted me and my way of thinking, they just work for me.

The older I get, the more I reflect on things, not because I am wiser, but because I enjoy going back over my steps... old people's trait, I guess. 


1. If you have nothing good to say, stay shut. This one alone is dangerous to follow blindly. In a world of voices, the quiet stays unheard. If you are trying to start a conversation or just trying to be noticed, but have nothing smart to say or a story to tell: **ask questions**. People love getting the spotlight and telling you about them.

2. You will regret far more often what you say than what you keep. Try to **choose your words** wisely. If you must say something, try doing so with a clear head and a full stomach.

3. Silence your inner voice when someone is talking to you. When people are trying to tell you something, **listen** to them. We all want to throw that next sentence or that clever comeback, but focus on the message you're receiving. Your answer will be less stupid if you do.

4. Be **present**. And I don't mean the RTO bullshit. I mean be there when you are doing something. Be there when you spend time with people. Gain some awareness that the moment is happening. Your phone can wait, but time waits for no one.

5. When you need to deliver things, deliver what's correct to the definition, not to you. Crafting things requires **attention** to detail. One of those details is the definition of what's needed. Stick to the plan first, improve the results later. Most people who fail to deliver, fail to get this one right. Either they put together what feels enough for them, which generally is too little or too much.

6. **Focus**. This one is harder than it looks. Focus is a special state of mind. It is precious and you need to protect this with your whole self.

7. Software, just like people, needs **limits**. I think we can present it the other way around and still is a good lesson. Limits provide scope and clarity.

8. **Simplicity** is everything. Complexity is everywhere, but control is nowhere. Aim for simplicity, that's where control lies.

9. **Beware of a fool with conviction**. In this world of AI and people with no values, there is nothing more dangerous than fools and the ignorant pretending they know better. Don't be afraid of calling that out. Even if you're the only one doing so.

10. **Invest in your health** far more than you do in happiness. At some point in your life, these two will mean the same.

11. Treat resources as **finite**. Only ambition and idiocy ignore that rule.

12. Treat people and things with **respect**. I think I should not explain why, but come on.

13. **Have a plan**. Doing things just because, leaves results to the universe, and the universe is chaos. Having a plan will let you know when you succeeded and also when you failed.

14. Learn to **find joy in what you do**, rather than only doing what you enjoy. In the latter, a fool will come along and take that away from you most of the time.

15. **Take off your shoes at the doorstep**. Maybe it is odd for us in western cultures, but it makes sense the more you think about it.

16. Not everything makes sense. Words and concepts come from context and ideas, sometimes these don't survive time, but their meaning does. This one resonates the loudest with languages; sometimes all you need to do is **memorize**.

17. Build for the rule, test for the exception.

18. Check your facts. In this era of slop and hallucinations this is non-trivial anymore. If you tell a story, do some research work, inaccuracy in a time where tools and knowledge are at our fingertips is a destructive trait.
